# Chess AI

A Python-based Chess AI that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to evaluate board positions and make strategic decisions. Trained on official tournament game data, this project explores how machine learning can simulate intelligent gameplay.

---

## Overview

This project aims to build a basic Chess-playing AI using deep learning techniques. The model learns from board state evaluations and attempts to mimic human-like gameplay through pattern recognition and move prediction.

## Features

- Board state representation using UCI notation
- CNN-based evaluation of chess positions and move prediction
- Legal move generation and selection
- Support for playing against the AI
